# Video Game Ratings Analysis 
A heavy analysis of video game data pertaining to the ratings issued by both gamers and critics. This project was done with the programming language Python (utilizing its' scientific computing libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn). An emphasis was placed on data cleaning and analysis more so than statistical modeling. A research paper was then written that explained the motivation, procedures, problems, and findings of the analysis.
